        <p> I believe that this type of certificate has many advantages, including the flexibility to work in many different places and even countries, it is flexibility will allow us to have more quality time with our families. A negative point is that it is a bit sedentary, therefore acquiring hobbies that keep us in shape is essential.</p>
